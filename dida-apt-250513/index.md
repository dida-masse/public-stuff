# Staff planning with the 
# Marker game

---

# Brief history

At DITE work was organized in _Core groups_;
each course was planned and executed by a small team, 3-5 co-workers.

Over time, this became too fragmented; 

 _involvment in several different groups/courses simultaneously_

 _groups changed significantly throughout the year_



```_Something else was needed_```

---

### history contd

We reorganiezed in larger teams (4-8);


**GOALS:**

- each team were responsible for courses over the whole academic year (such as all courses in a programme)

- each team consisting of people with various roles teachers, researchers, course responsible, examiners 

- each team had a shared responsibility to plan and implement the activities that had been committed to.

# Staff planning - Marker game

- To plan staffing resources we did this as a board "game" - _The Marker Game_.
  
- During one day, all staff participated in the event, and the goal was to staff all courses and determine where everyone’s working hours would be allocated.

- Although the primary goal was to staff all courses for the year, other activities such as projects, research time, and additional responsibilities were also included.

# The Marker Game - How

The game worked as follows:

- All courses were laid out on tables, as paper sheets, providing a chronological overview of the courses over the year.
- Hours for courses was based on a course budget, projects and had it's hours and other activities had fixed hour allocations, and so on.

### contd The Marker Game

- Each participant received tokens (poker chips), which together represented their annual working hours. 
- Deductions were made for things like professional development, departmental duties etc
- Participants placed their tokens – their time – on the activities they were going to be involved in.

(_notes were also written on large post-its_)

# Advantages

Advantages:
Transparency:
Everyone can see how resources are allocated and what colleagues are planning to work on.

Participation and engagement:
Staff are actively involved in the planning process, which can increase their sense of ownership and motivation.

Better understanding of the big picture:
By viewing the full year’s course offerings and activities, everyone gains a clearer overview of the organization’s operations.

Encourages dialogue and collaboration:
Discussions naturally arise around priorities, workload, and coordination.

Practical problem-solving on the spot:
Since everyone is present, conflicts, double bookings, and other practical issues can be resolved immediately.

Visual and tangible method:
Planning becomes easier to grasp and manage when visualized with tokens/markers and notes.

# Disadvantages:

**Time-consuming**
Gathering all staff and conducting the game can take a lot of time, especially in larger organizations.

Requires physical presence:
The method depends on everyone being in the same place at the same time, which can be challenging in hybrid or remote settings.

Risk of unequal influence:
Some individuals may dominate discussions or influence others’ choices, leading to imbalances in task distribution.
